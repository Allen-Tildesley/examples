# Reporting bugs

First, thanks for your interest in these example codes.

The "Issues" system on this GitHub repository is intended for reporting bugs, errors, and other mistakes in these codes and their documentation.
We welcome any such reports, and will endeavour to fix bugs as quickly as possible.

Please feel free to open an issue in the following circumstances,
assuming that you have already checked any current open issues, to avoid duplication.
* You have discovered a definite bug or error in any of the Fortran or Python files. Please state clearly which file the error is in, and the nature of the error.
* You have come across a mistake, or a broken link, in the documentation (the GUIDE.md files or the Wiki pages). Please specify exactly where the mistake is.


Here are some examples of things _not_ to raise as issues.

* Feature or enhancement requests. These example programs are solely intended to illustrate points made in the text.
* General questions about molecular simulation methods. Discussions of this kind are outside the scope of this site.
* Questions relating to building or running the codes on your specific computer system.

Finally, please note that errata in the text of the book itself are summarized in a different repository: <https://github.com/Allen-Tildesley/corrections>. If you spot an error in the book, please report it there!
