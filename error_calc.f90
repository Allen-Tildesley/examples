  ! We must take account of the correlations between successive values in time
  ! The two common methods which follow are actually very similar
  ! They differ in the choice of block lengths

  ! Traditional block analysis
  ! The rationale here is that 20 (say) independent block averages should be enough to get a reasonable
  ! estimate of the desired quantities, and that there is not a lot to gain by looking at more (shorter) blocks.
  ! Some workers just assume that the run may be divided into 10 or 20 blocks, which they hope will be independent.
  ! This is exactly what we do in our example programs, just for simplicity.
  ! We cannot recommend this in general, unless there is good reason to support the assumption of independence.
  ! If the 20 blocks are not independent, then attention should be focused on fewer (longer) blocks,
  ! rather than more (shorter) ones, and a plot of squared error estimate, or statistical inefficiency,
  ! vs 1/tblock carried out to extrapolate to tblock=nstep. The loop below provides the data for that plot.

  ! Note that, in this implementation, we over-write the data array a
  ! Advantages of this method are the very neat method for reducing the data
  ! and the formal scaling analysis that accompanies the blocking transformation
  ! The basic calculation is the same as for the traditional block-averaging,
  ! but the block length, and hence tblock, change by a factor 2 each time.
  ! Advocates of Flyvbjerg and Petersen might argue that the additional data points
  ! at low nblock (high tblock) which are calculated in the traditional method
  ! do not actually provide much new (independent) information.
  ! One may attempt an extrapolation of si or a_err**2 as a function of 1/tblock
  ! but F&P suggest estimating a plateau in a plot vs number of blocking transformations
  ! which is essentially log2(tblock)
