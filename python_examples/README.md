The programs contain some explanatory comments,
and are written in Python3 using the NumPy and SciPy libraries.
The [User Guide](./GUIDE.md) contains some comments on the Python language,
some notes to assist in running the programs,

We have used Python 3.6.0 for testing.
The Python versions do not require building, they are simply run through the Python interpreter.
