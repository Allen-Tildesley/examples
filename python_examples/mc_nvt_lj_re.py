# Takes in a configuration of atoms (positions)
# Cubic periodic boundary conditions
# Conducts Monte Carlo at the given temperature
# Uses no special neighbour lists
# Uses MPI to run replica exchange of configurations with neighbouring temperatures
# Assume at most 100 processes numbered 0 to 99

# All processes write to their standard output, but the default in MPI is for all this output
# to be collated (in an undefined order) and written to a single channel. We assume that the program
# will be run with a command-line which includes an option for each process to write to separate files, such as
#          mpiexec -n 8 -output-filename out ./mc_nvt_lj_re.py < mc.inp
# where the standard output files are named out##, the ## part being determined by the process rank.
# If your implementation does not have this option, you should edit the code to explicitly open a file for
# standard output, with a process-rank-dependent name, and associate the output_unit with it.

# Note that configurations are read, saved, and written to files named cnf##.inp etc
# NB a program intended for real-world application would be much more careful about
# closing down all the MPI processes cleanly in the event of an error on any one process.
# However, the documentation for mpi4py currently states that the MPI Init and Finalize are
# automatically called on importing the MPI module and on Python process exit, respectively.
# Therefore, we don't call them explicitly here.

# Reads several variables and options from standard input using JSON format
# Leave input empty "{}" to accept supplied defaults

# Positions r are divided by box length after reading in
# However, input configuration, output configuration, most calculations, and all results
# are given in simulation units defined by the model
# For example, for Lennard-Jones, sigma = 1, epsilon = 1

# Despite the program name, there is nothing here specific to Lennard-Jones
# The model is defined in mc_lj_module
